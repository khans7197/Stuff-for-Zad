Programming Assignment 2  For nice pictures and Marking Scheme, Rubtic too see Google  Classroom.

# Question 1:
NOTE:  The first question is not the easiest, but you can work on it immediately as we’ve taken recursion already.  You may use anything I have given you for guidance, but it must be your own work, nothing copied from the web.
  
•	Recursion You may NOT DO:
•	Koch snowflake
•	the tree method 
•	Pascal’s Triangle

A turtle always knows where it currently sits and what direction it is facing.  To draw a Koch curve of a given length and degree, you might use an algorithm like:
	
Your Task – create a recursive function using turtle – this must be unique and CANNOT be from the internet.  

1.	Create a flowchart for this problem
2.	Create an IPO chart for this problem
3.	Create a trace (table in any form) for this question when you have an error and hand it in.
4.	Hand in your unique Recursive program.
	
Implement this algorithm with a Turtle class that contains instance variables location (a point) and Direction (a float?) and moveTo (somePoint), draw (length), and turn (degrees).

A little advanced math if you are stuck (you do not need to use this):
If you are maintaining direction as an angle in radians, the point you are going to can be computed from your current location direction x = length * cos(direction) and current location direction y = length * sin(direction)

IMPORTANT NOTE:  Contrary to all other assignments, your algorithm can be very basic and working for a level 3. (Application and Thinking).  You must have a base case and your program must end.  Use error capture.  BE very careful in your attempt to earn a Level 4 – you must cite all your sources AND must not borrow more than 25% of your code.
 
# Question 2:
Please create a flowchart, IPO chart and trace table for a particular guess.:
 
Weeks ago you were given a version 1 and then a version 2 of hangman.  You are to complete this task, use versioning and commit regularly as you add each piece, nothing hardcoded. You must use PyGame. Your words will be input from either a txt file or a csv file, your choice.  Your word list should come from the hardware components, upcoming readings from Week 9 OR from the Debates to Apr 4th.  Please let me know which version you were on (code on the right) so that I may see the code and match up the trace table (with unfixed) code.  Obviously the code you hand in will be fixed.  A mark of zero for no trace table will be awarded, as I do not believe you will have zero errors.  

# Question 3:
4)	Please create a flowchart, IPO chart and trace table for a particular error you had while creating your work.  Please let me know which version you were on (code on the right) so that I may see the code and match up the trace table (with unfixed) code.  Obviously the code you hand in will be fixed.  A mark of zero for no trace table as I do not believe you will have zero errors.
  
Your task, create a “Farkle” or “Beat That” game using the PyGame die class created in class.  You will need complete instructions that area checkable for your user.

# Question 4:
Please create a flowchart, IPO chart and trace table for a particular error you had while creating your work.  Please let me know which version you were on (GitHub code/version) so that I may see the code and match up the trace table to that (now fixed) code.
  
Your task, create either Cribbage or 31 or an easy option using the Card class you and your classmates created. (Easy option with highest possible mark 3- for a matching game)

a)	Easy choice (highest level possible is a Level 3-).  In this option you will create a basic matching game.  Consider that Hearts and Diamonds match (red) and Spades and Clubs match (Black).  You must use at least a 5 x 5 set of cards and the entire deck.is at your disposal.  You will need complete instructions for your user.

b)	More difficult option, (full marks possible). You will create the game of 31 or Cribbage also using the PyGame Card class created in class. You will need complete instructions for your user.
The rules are blocked at school - please look them up at home - you may have success with Wikopedia at school.


# Question 5:
WOW me with your Pygame Sprite knowledge – you may begin with the sprite given in class, (week of Apr 8th), but do not need to.
Have fun with this one!
